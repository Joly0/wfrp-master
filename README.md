## What is it good for?

- Manage Player Characters inside the app.
- Track NPCs and simplify Combat tracking (Wounds of all the Combatants, Advantage, Determining Initiative).
- Skills, Talents, and more from official Cubicle 7 PDFs. No need to search the Rulebook for the spell effect in the middle of the combat.
- Access your data from multiple devices, all data are synced to Cloud.

## User documentation (WIKI)

For both players and GMs, there is a [documentation](https://github.com/fmasa/wfrp-master/wiki) for various features and mechanics used in the app. 

## Translations
